# My Nix Config

Darwin + Home Manager deployments with Nix

## Snippets

### First Install

- [Install git](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/git), if you haven't already.
- Create a repository for your config, for example:

```bash
cd ~/github/sm17p/
git clone https://github.com/sm17p/dotfiles
make bootstrap-mac
```

- Make sure you're running Nix 2.4+, and opt into the experimental `flakes` and `nix-command` features:

```bash

# Should be 2.4+
nix --version
export NIX_CONFIG="experimental-features = nix-command flakes"
```

### Usage

- Run `make darwin-rebuild .#hostname` to apply your system
  configuration.

## Adding more hosts or users

You can organize them by hostname and username on `nixos` and `home-manager`
directories, be sure to also add them to `flake.nix`.

There's also [more advanced options for secret
management](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Comparison_of_secret_managing_schemes),
including some that can include them (encrypted) into your config repo and/or
nix store, be sure to check them out if you're interested.

## Dotfile management with home-manager

Besides just adding packages to your environment, home-manager can also manage
your dotfiles. I strongly recommend you do, it's awesome!

For full nix goodness, check out the home-manager options with `man
home-configuration.nix`. Using them, you'll be able to fully configure any
program with nix syntax and its powerful abstractions.

Alternatively, if you're still not ready to rewrite all your configs to nix
syntax, there's home-manager options (such as `xdg.configFile`) for including
files from your config repository into your usual dot directories. Add your
existing dotfiles to this repo and try it out!

## Try opt-in persistance

You might have noticed that there's impurity in your NixOS system, in the form
of configuration files and other cruft your system generates when running. What
if you change them in a whim to get something working and forget about it?
Boom, your system is not fully reproductible anymore.

You can instead fully delete your `/` and `/home` on every boot! Nix is okay
with a empty root on boot (all you need is `/boot` and `/nix`), and will
happily reapply your configurations.

There's two main approaches to this: mount a `tmpfs` (RAM disk) to `/`, or
(using a filesystem such as btrfs or zfs) mount a blank snapshot and reset it
on boot.

For stuff that can't be managed through nix (such as games downloaded from
steam, or logs), use [impermanence](https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence)
for mounting stuff you to keep to a separate partition/volume (such as
`/nix/persist` or `/persist`). This makes everything vanish by default, and you
can keep track of what you specifically asked to be kept.

Here's some awesome blog posts about it:

## Adding custom packages

Something you want to use that's not in nixpkgs yet? You can easily build and
iterate on a derivation (package) from this very repository.

Create a folder with the desired name inside `pkgs`, and add a `default.nix`
file containing a derivation. Be sure to also `callPackage` them on
`pkgs/default.nix`.

You'll be able to refer to that package from anywhere on your
home-manager/nixos configurations, build them with `nix build .#package-name`,
or bring them into your shell with `nix shell .#package-name`.

See [the manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/) for some tips on how
to package stuff.

## Adding overlays

Found some outdated package on nixpkgs you need the latest version of? Perhaps
you want to apply a patch to fix a behaviour you don't like? Nix makes it easy
and manageble with overlays!

Use the `overlays/default.nix` file for this.

If you're creating patches, you can keep them on the `overlays` folder as well.

See [the wiki article](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Overlays) to see how it all
works.

## Adding your own modules

Got some configurations you want to create an abstraction of? Modules are the
answer. These awesome files can expose _options_ and implement _configurations_
based on how the options are set.

Create a file for them on either `modules/nixos` or `modules/home-manager`. Be
sure to also add them to the listing at `modules/nixos/default.nix` or
`modules/home-manager/default.nix`.

See [the wiki article](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Module) to learn more about
them.
